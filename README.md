Description
This project is a Role-Based Authentication System built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It enables user authentication, secure access to resources, and role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles such as Admin & User. The system ensures that only authorized users can access specific resources based on their assigned roles.

Features
User Registration:
Users and admins can register with unique credentials.
Profile images can be uploaded during registration.

Login & Authentication:
Secure login using JWT (JSON Web Token).
Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for enhanced security.

Role-Based Access Control:
Specific resources are accessible only to users with appropriate roles.
Middleware enforces access restrictions dynamically based on roles.

CRUD Operations:
Users can view, edit, and delete their profiles.
Admins can manage users.

File Upload:
Users and admins can upload profile pictures during registration.

Tech Stack
Backend: Node.js, Express.js
Database: MongoDB (Mongoose for ORM)
Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token), bcrypt
File Upload: Multer
Middleware: Custom middleware for authentication and role-based access control
